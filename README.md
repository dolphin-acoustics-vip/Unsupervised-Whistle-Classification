Unsupervised Whistle Classification, by Ayam Babu

This project is part of the Dolphin Acoustics VIP, looking to explore models that could be used to cluster dolphin whistles without knowing how different whistles look like. The project is focusing on classifying signature whistles, which can be used to identify individual dolphins. In the first semester, I worked on designing and experimenting with unsupervised methods to form a baseline classifier. In the second semester, I experimented with changing different parts of the first semester models to observe how they impact the results. I have explained my work from the last two semesters in more detail below:
